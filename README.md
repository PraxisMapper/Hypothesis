Short version: Ads suck. Tracking data sucks. This app uses neither for monetary purposes. It send an ID to the leaderboards only to update your scores on the leaderboard.

Long version: This app sends data to a leaderboard server. The data contains your software device ID and aggregates of your activity in the app. No personal data or specific location history is ever sent off of the device. Location history is stored local to the application, and only while the application is running, for gameplay purposes. The server will never be told which locations you have been to, only how many in total.
